They take action and make decisions slowly. This pace stems from their desire to avoid risky or unknown situations. Before they take action or make a decision, they have to know how other people feel about their decision. Amiables tend to be the most people-oriented of all the four styles. Having close, friendly, personal, first –name relationships with others is one of their most important objectives. They dislike interpersonal conflict so much that they sometimes say what they think other people want to hear. They have natural counseling skills and are supportive. Their theme is, “Notice how well-liked I am.” Amiables tend to be good, active listeners and generally develop relationships with people who are also good listeners. As a result, Amiables have strong networks of people who are willing to be mutually supportive. You often feel good just being with an Amiable.",

They tend to be cool, independent, and competitive with others, especially in a business environment. Drivers try to shape their environment to overcome obstacle en route to their accomplishments. They demand maximum freedom to manage themselves and others, and use their leadership skills to become winners. Their weak traits include stubbornness, impatience, and toughness. Drivers tend to take control of others and have a low tolerance for their feelings, attitudes, and inadequacies. They are fast-paced and are impatient with delays. It is not unusual for a Driver to call you and, without saying hello, launch right into the conversation: “You’ve got to be kidding; the shipment from Hong Kong will kill us…, by the way, this is Jack.” When other people cannot keep up with their speed, they view them as incompetent. The Driver’s motto might be, “I want it done right and I want it done now,” or, “I want it done yesterday!” They like to juggle three things at once, and when they feel comfortable with those three things, they pick up a fourth. They keep adding more until the pressure builds to the point where they let everything drop, then immediately start the whole process over again. The Driver’s theme may be, “Notice my accomplishments.” Their strengths are their ability to get things done, their leadership, and their decision-making ability. Their weaknesses tend to be inflexibility, impatience, poor listening habits, and failure to take time to “smell the flowers.” ",
